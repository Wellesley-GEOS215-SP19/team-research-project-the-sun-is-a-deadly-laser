The following directory:

ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/products/stnplots/

is comprised of sub-directories (that are named by the first digit of a station
ID) that contain individual station plot files (in "gif" format).

The plot files contain 9 individual graphs, arranged in a 3x3 matrix.  The first
column of graphs, contain 2-D colored symbol graphs of the actual monthly data
for the entire period of record for A) the (Q)uality (C)ontrolled (U)nadjusted
(QCU) data, B) the (Q)uality (C)ontrolled (A)djusted (QCA) data, and C) the
differences between QCA and QCU monthly data.  The second column of graphs
contain histograms of the monthly data for QCU, QCA, and (QCA-QCU) respectively.
Finally, the third column of graphs depict annual anomalies and their associated
trend line for QCU and QCA, and the differences in the annual anomalies for QCA
and QCU. Detailed axis titles and units are displayed in the title of each
graph.
